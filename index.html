                            <h2> About Mother Teresa</h2>
                            <p> 
                                        Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary, 
                                        widely admired for her lifelong dedication to helping the poor, sick, and dying. 
                                        She founded the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India, 
                                        which grew into a global organization serving the most marginalized. 
                                        Known for her humility, compassion, and selfless service, 
                                        she received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. 
                                        Mother Teresa’s life is remembered as a shining example of love, kindness, and unwavering 
                                        commitment to humanity.
